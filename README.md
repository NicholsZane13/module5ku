# module5ku

The goal of this project was to get comfortable with jquery and bootstrap to create a working scheduler. This was a unique project because it uses different attributes of coding that require levels of thinking in depth that haven't been used as much before in previous lessons. It was an exciting challenge that I am glad to have accomplished understanding and completing.
